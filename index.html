			<h3>Hawkeye Programming Challenges</h3>
			<p>This year (2018) I will be participating in the annual <a href="https://outreach.uiowa.edu/program/hawkeye-challenge-programming-competition-computer-science">Hawkeye Programming Challenge</a>! In order to prepare myself, I've taken on the challenges from the two previous years.</p>

			<h3>PiTV</h3>
			<p>I barely use the TV in my room, and so I'm making an effort to create a program that will run on my raspberry pi to occupy this digital space. The whole purpose is for it to have widgets, for example grabbing my events off of iCloud and displaying date, time, audio, video, and more.</p>
