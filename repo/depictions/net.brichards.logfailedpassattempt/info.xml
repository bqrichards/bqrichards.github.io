		<description>Logs failed passcode data to /var/mobile/failedpasscodedata. This was requested on the r/jailbreak subreddit by /u/t2magician. WORKS ON IOS 10 ONLY.</description>
		<description>If you want it for iOS 11 I could make that work, just let me know. I just made it specifically for iOS 10 because that's the device version it was requested for.</description>
